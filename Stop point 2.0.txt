This is an example of a incomplete word "e11" that does not have any matches matches in the tfl api data base. When this type of result happens with a 
word that has been entered which has no matches in the tfl api data base can you do an error box with a message saying: "Text entered incorrectly" 


This "SE5 8RW" is one of many full complete working postcodes that are direct locations and will also show empty disambiguation boxes
but it is a valid result not an error so it does not need to be high lighted in red and display the message " 📍 Multiple matches found for "SE5 8RW"
Please select one: No matches found for "SE5 8RW" " because a post code is a direct pin point location with in tfl's api database that I can move 
forward in the journey process with on click of "Plan Journey" button, as long as the location in the second / other text field is with 
in tfl's api database, un like "e11" which is an incomplete postcode which I can't move forward with on click of the "Plan Journey" button 
which is correct functionality. 
If the postcode is fully complete, correct and with in the tfl api database can you remove the red error high lights and message:"📍 Multiple matches found for "SE5 8RW"
Please select one:

No matches found for "SE5 8RW"" because it's not an error 
and make it so the message says: 📍 Postcode found "SE5 8RW"

not show 
not a Can you high light in red any empty disambiguation boxes
